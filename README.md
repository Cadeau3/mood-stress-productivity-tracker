Mood, Stress & Productivity Tracker  
A lightweight, fully interactive wellness analytics tool for exploring personal patterns in mood, sleep, stress, productivity, and daily activities.  
Built as a single-page web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js.

---

## 🌱 Overview
The Mood, Stress & Productivity Tracker helps users understand how daily habits and emotional patterns evolve over time. It allows users to log entries—mood, sleep hours, stress level, productivity hours, and short activity notes—and then visualizes these patterns using interactive charts. The tool computes correlations, simple regression lines, and automatic insights to help users interpret their own data in a clear and meaningful way.

All data is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`, so no account or server is needed.
